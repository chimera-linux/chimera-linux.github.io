This assumes you have partitioned your target drive and formatted
your partitions with the necessary filesystems.

## Mounting

The first thing before you install the OS is to mount the partitions
with the desired layout matching the final system.

First, you need to mount the root partition. Create a mount point
for it first:

```
# mkdir /media/root
```

Then mount it (assuming `/dev/sda2` for root partition):

```
# mount /dev/sda2 /media/root
```

Make sure that the root file system's mount has 755 permissions.
If it for some reason does not and instead it's for example 700,
it will result in strange issues when logging in as non-root.
The fix for that is easy:

```
# chmod 755 /media/root
```

Then you can move on to the other partitions.

### UEFI

You will want to mount the EFI System Partition as well. There
are several locations, based on your layout. First, let's assume
that the ESP is `/dev/sda1`.

If you have a dedicated `/boot` partition (let's say `sda3`),
mount it first:

```
# mkdir /media/root/boot
# mount /dev/sda3 /media/root/boot
```

Regardless, mount the ESP:

```
# mkdir -p /media/root/boot/efi
# mount /dev/sda1 /media/root/boot/efi
```

If your ESP and `/boot` are merged, do this instead:

```
# mkdir /media/root/boot
# mount /dev/sda1 /media/root/boot
```

### Other partitions

You will also want to mount other physical partitions you are
using in the locations where they are going to be. Do keep in mind
that for nested mountpoints, always mount parent partitions first.

## Installation

There are two ways you can install the system onto a partitioned,
mounted drive. One is a local installation, which copies the live
system onto the drive (but without live-related bits), the other
is a remote installation from the repositories.

Note that local installation is only available when booted from
a live ISO image. When installing from another Chimera system,
e.g. when booted from an SD card with a device image flashed,
you can only perform a network installation.

For both cases, you use the `chimera-bootstrap` program. The
tool supports `-h` for a help listing.

### Local installation

To perform a local installation with `chimera-bootstrap`, the `-l`
option is required. Invoke it like this:

```
# chimera-bootstrap -l /media/root
```

### Network installation

This is the default mode. By default, `base-full` will be installed
into the root; you can override this by passing a custom list of
packages after the root filesystem argument.

```
# chimera-bootstrap /media/root
```

You can technically perform this from any booted Chimera system, as
the `chimera-install-scripts` are a part of any base installation.

## Prepare the system

Regardless of the installation method you choose, you will need to
open a shell in the target system to install updates, possibly other
packages you need to boot, and the bootloader.

The `chimera-chroot` tool exists to simplify that task for you.
It will mount the pseudo-filesystems for the session as well as
ensure you have network access inside.

```
# chimera-chroot /media/root
```

First, update the system. If installing from the network, this might
not do anything.

```
# apk update
# apk upgrade --available
```

If `apk update` fails, make sure your system date/time is set to a
correct value. Incorrectly configured date/time can result in HTTPS
certificate errors. If the date/time is indeed wrong, you can set it
with the `date` command:

```
# date YYYYMMDDHHmm
```

Replace the value with the current date/time, typically in UTC, as you
do not have a timezone set yet.

If you run into any other errors, such as conflicting packages
overwriting each other's files, don't worry; just fix it:

```
# apk fix
```

After that, try again and there should be no more errors:

```
# apk upgrade --available
```

At this point you might also want to enable the `contrib` repository
if you plan to install software from there (which there is a good
chance you will):

```
# apk add chimera-repo-contrib
```

And refresh indexes again to make it propagate:

```
# apk update
```

### Device base package

For devices that would use device images, a special base package
is needed.

For example, for Raspberry Pi:

```
# apk add base-rpi
```

For Pinebook Pro:

```
# apk add base-pbp
```

And so on. The format is always `base-PLATFORM`, with a list of
platforms available [here](https://github.com/chimera-linux/chimera-live/blob/master/mkrootfs-platform.sh).

A lot of the device packages are in the `contrib` repo.

The base packages for U-Boot devices come with a default kernel command
line in `/etc/u-boot-cmdline`. This contains a pre-defined `root=` parameter
that is suitable for the default partitioning as shipped with the device
images. This will not work with custom partition layouts, for exmaple when
using LVM/LUKS or when your partition label is different, and it's only
present so that U-Boot configuration can be generated statically without
executing code in the target root, so you can remove it (the U-Boot menu
generator will figure out the root from the current configuration).

**This needs to be done before installing the kernel.**

### Kernel installation

If you performed a local installation from the live image, it already
comes with a kernel.

Otherwise you might have to add it:

```
# apk add linux-lts
```

If you wish to use ZFS, add that too:

```
# apk add linux-lts-zfs-bin
```

This typically refers to the latest Long Term Support version of the Linux
kernel. If you'd like to use the latest stable version of the kernel
instead, for example if LTS is missing some functionality or driver
that is important to you, you can install `linux-stable` instead:

```
# apk add linux-stable
```

Likewise, you can add `linux-stable-zfs-bin` for binary ZFS modules.

Device-specific kernel may sometimes be needed. For example for Raspberry Pi,
you will want to use `linux-rpi` instead of the above (ZFS modules likewise
exist for it). Chimera typically avoids shipping device-specific kernels
though, so they are rare in the repositories.

### Fstab

Strictly speaking, a Chimera system does not need `/etc/fstab` to boot.
Having an entry for the root filesystem is optional and you might not
have any other filesystems. However, it is recommended that you have
a proper `fstab`, with which you can control mount flags as well as
`fsck` behavior or e.g. whether the root filesystem is mounted read-only.

The installation scripts come with a `fstab` generator. You can invoke
it like:

```
# genfstab / > /etc/fstab
```

It is also possible to invoke it from the outside of the system, e.g.
like:

```
# genfstab /media/root > /media/root/etc/fstab
```

You might want to manually edit the generated `fstab` to remove useless
mount options and so on.

If you have a swap partition and you want it automatically included in
the `fstab`, activate the swap partition before generating it. Otherwise,
you can also include it manually.

The default `fstab` that comes with the system does not contain any entries.

An example `/etc/fstab` for a root partition and ESP may look like this:

```
UUID=... / ext4 defaults 0 1
UUID=... /boot/efi vfat defaults 0 2
```

It is not necessary to add entries for pseudo-filesystems such as the
`/proc` or `/sys` mounts. If you want to have read-only `/` partition
you will also have to add a `tmpfs` entry for `/tmp`, as the directory
needs to be globally writable. On other systems, you do not need such
entry and `/tmp` does not need to be a mount (it will be periodically
cleaned).

In general the order of the rows should be root filesystem first and
other filesystems after that, as they are mounted in that order and
parent mounts need to be mounted first.

The first column identifies the device. It is recommended that you always
use unique paths such as `UUID=...` or `PARTUUID=...` (using alias paths
such as `/dev/disk/by-partuuid` or `/dev/disk/by-uuid` will work as well),
as names such as `/dev/sda` may change. For encrypted devices, you will
want to use the `/dev/mapper` paths, e.g. `/dev/mapper/crypt-root`.

The second column is the mount point. The entries should be specified
in an order so that parent mounts come first.

The third column specifies the file system, and the fourth column contains
the mount options for it.

The fifth column should usually be `0` and relates to `dump(8)`. The sixth
column specifies the order for `fsck(8)`. Normally the root filesystem
should specify `1` and other filesystems should specify `2`.

If the root filesystem is not specified in `fstab`, Chimera will mount it
as if it was specified with `defaults`, and will `fsck` it as if the sixth
column was `1`.

For more information, see `fstab(5)`.

### Other packages

You can install whichever other packages you like.

### Root password

Set your root password here, or you will not be able to log in:

```
# passwd root
```

### Serial login prompt (getty)

While the live image autodetects this and lets you log in over serial
terminal, the final system does not, and will only by default enable
graphical `getty`.

So for example you might want to do something like:

```
# dinitctl -o enable agetty-ttyS0
```

If the baud rate or other parameters need tweaking, you can copy them
from the live system (e.g. `/etc/default/agetty-ttyS0`), as the live
autodetection generates a configuration file if necessary.

### Initramfs refresh

A bootable system will typically need an initramfs image. You need to
create one near the end, but before generating your bootloader config,
as the bootloader needs to be aware of it.

Therefore, best do that now:

```
# update-initramfs -c -k all
```

### GRUB

GRUB is a common bootloader that works on more or less every platform
that Chimera supports. If you wish to use a different way to boot your
system, or you can't use GRUB (e.g. for U-Boot devices, Raspberry Pis,
and so on), skip this section.

First you will need to add it.

Example for x86 BIOS:

```
# apk add grub-i386-pc
```

Example for x86_64 EFI:

```
# apk add grub-x86_64-efi
```

Example for a POWER virtual machine, Power Mac or PowerVM hardware:

```
# apk add grub-powerpc-ieee1275
```

On a PowerNV machine with Petitboot, you do not need any low level bootloader
as the machine comes with one, so just add `grub`. On other platforms, there
are more choices, e.g. `grub-arm64-efi`, `grub-i386-coreboot`, `grub-i386-efi`,
`grub-riscv64-efi`, `grub-x86_64-xen`.

The installation will differ slightly depending on the platform. For exmaple
for BIOS systems:

```
# grub-install /dev/sda
```

On OpenPOWER systems (which use Petitboot), you will not install the
bootloader but instead you need to create the directory for the config:

```
# mkdir /boot/grub
```

On POWER systems with a PReP partition:

```
# grub-install /dev/sda1
```

On Power Macs it's a little more complicated (and needs `hfsutils`):

```
# mkdir -p /boot/macppc
# mount -t hfs /dev/sda2 /boot/macppc
# grub-install --macppc-directory=/boot/macppc /dev/sda2
# umount /boot/macppc
# rmdir /boot/macppc
# hmount /dev/sda2
# hattrib -t tbxi -c UNIX :System:Library:CoreServices:BootX
# hattrib -b :System:Library:CoreServices
# humount
```

On EFI systems with separate ESP:

```
# mkdir -p /boot/efi
# mount /dev/sda1 /boot/efi
# grub-install --efi-directory=/boot/efi
```

And so on. You will want `--target=x86_64-efi` as well if installing EFI on
x86_64 while booted in BIOS mode.

If you do not want GRUB to alter firmware boot entries, `--no-nvram` can be
passed. Additionally, certain EFI firmwares are buggy and require a bootable
file at a known location before they show any NVRAM entries. In this case
the system may not boot. This does not affect most systems, but if you have
a board with such buggy firmware, you can pass the `--removable` flag to
work around it.

Without using `--removable`, a similar workaround will also work:

```
# mv /boot/efi/EFI/chimera /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT
# mv /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/grubx64.efi /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI
```

On Power Macs it is recommended to turn off graphical GRUB, which can be
done by uncommenting `GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT=console` in `/etc/default/grub`.
You may also want to add `GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=true` to prevent GRUB
from scanning other drives (which slows down the config generation).

In any case, you will want to generate a GRUB configuration file on all
platforms:

```
# update-grub
```

### U-Boot

For devices using U-Boot, it is needed to flash it:

```
# install-u-boot /dev/mmcblk0
```

The whole target device needs to be passed, not a partition.

After that, you might want to refresh the menu entries just in case:

```
# update-u-boot
```

If your partitioning is somehow special, double-check whether `/boot/extlinux.conf`
contains the correct `root=` parameter, in case you forgot to remove the
pre-defined one.

### Raspberry Pi

No special setup is necessary for booting on Raspberry Pi, except possibly for
tweaking the cmdline (`/boot/cmdline.txt`) to reflect your partition and filesystem
layout. If your filesystem (not partition) is labeled `root`, no changes should
be necessary.

## Other post-installation tasks

At this point, the system should be capable of booting on its own.

If you wish, you can perform other post-installation tasks here, or you can
do so after you have booted into the system.

Either way, proceed to [Post-installation](/docs/configuration/post-installation).
